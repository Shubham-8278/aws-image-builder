# EC2 Image Builder Pipeline using CloudFormation

This project sets up an automated EC2 Image Builder pipeline using **AWS CloudFormation**. 

---

## üì¶ Overview

This CloudFormation template automates the creation of a golden AMI using **EC2 Image Builder**. It supports:

- Custom base AMIs
- Cross-account AMI sharing
- Multiple architectures (x86_64 / ARM64)
- Tagging, logging, and version control

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **AWS CloudFormation**
- **EC2 Image Builder**
- **IAM Roles and Policies**
- **Amazon S3** (for storing scripts/components)
- **Amazon SNS** (optional for notifications)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured
- Proper IAM permissions to deploy EC2 Image Builder resources
- S3 bucket for custom components

### 2. Uplaod the scripts to the S3 using the upload-to-s3.sh

 - configure the parameters in the upload-to-s3.sh 
    - S3_BUCKET="awsbucketforttn"
    - S3_PREFIX="imagebuilder/scripts"
    - LOCAL_SCRIPT_DIR="./scripts"
- These scripts will be used to create the custom component that we will create and apply on the golden image 
 **Making Changes - Adding More Scripts** 
    - The main.sh is used as the main script runner if you want to add more files add the files to the script folder and link them in the main.sh

### 3. Creating IAM Role

## ‚úÖ Pros of EC2 Image Builder (Detailed)

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ **Fully Managed & Native AWS Service** | No need to install or manage additional tools. Works seamlessly with other AWS services like CloudWatch, SSM, IAM, and SNS. |
| ‚úÖ **Secure and Compliant AMI Pipeline** | Enforces best practices via component validation, IAM control, and integrated logs. Supports AWS Inspector, Patch Manager, and more. |
| ‚úÖ **Cross-Account AMI Sharing** | Out-of-the-box support for sharing AMIs across multiple AWS accounts using Image Builder distribution settings. |
| ‚úÖ **Supports Scheduling & Versioning** | You can set daily/weekly/monthly build schedules. AMI versioning is automatic with easy rollback capabilities. |
| ‚úÖ **Integrated with AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** | Reuse existing SSM documents or scripts as components, with centralized logging and inventory via SSM Agent. |
| ‚úÖ **Reduced Human Error** | Declarative YAML/JSON-based definitions with CloudFormation/CDK support help reduce manual steps. |
| ‚úÖ **Tighter Security** | Builder instances run temporarily in isolated environments with defined build lifecycles and auto-termination. |
| ‚úÖ **Automatic Cleanup** | Temporary infrastructure (like EC2 builder instances) is automatically shut down post-build. No dangling resources. |
| ‚úÖ **Cost-Efficient for Simple Workflows** | Pay only for the short-lived resources. No always-on servers required. |

## ‚ùå Cons of EC2 Image Builder (Detailed)

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| ‚ùå **Limited Customization** | Compared to Packer, it's harder to implement deeply customized workflows. You‚Äôre bound to the structure AWS provides (e.g., build/test/distribute stages). |
| ‚ùå **Slower Iteration Cycles** | Builds can take **10‚Äì30 minutes** for minor changes due to instance provisioning, testing, and distribution steps. |
| ‚ùå **No Local Debugging** | Unlike Packer, you can't test builds locally. You need to deploy to AWS to test even simple script updates. |
| ‚ùå **AWS-Only Ecosystem** | Image Builder is only for AWS. No multi-cloud/multi-provider support. If you're hybrid or multi-cloud, Packer is more flexible. |
| ‚ùå **Fewer Community Modules** | Unlike Packer's ecosystem (which has many ready-to-use modules), Image Builder relies on self-created components or basic SSM scripts. |
| ‚ùå **Approval Steps Require Extra Setup** | No built-in manual approval step (like CodePipeline). You‚Äôd need to build that separately using SNS + Lambda + approval logic. |
| ‚ùå **No Built-in CI/CD Integration** | Image Builder doesn‚Äôt natively integrate with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket. Requires external pipelines or triggering via CLI/API/CloudWatch Events. |
| ‚ùå **Output Visibility is Basic** | Logs are sent to CloudWatch Logs, but not as intuitive or visual as Packer's CLI output or GitHub Actions. No progress bar or step-by-step shell view. |

## üß≠ Typical EC2 Image Builder Workflow

1. **Define pipeline**  
   YAML or JSON via CloudFormation or UI. Includes source AMI, components, test phase, and distribution settings.

2. **Pipeline Trigger**  
   - Scheduled (e.g., nightly builds)
   - Manual trigger via AWS Console / CLI
   - Event-driven (e.g., via CloudWatch or Lambda)

3. **Image Build**  
   EC2 Image Builder launches a temporary EC2 instance ‚Üí installs components ‚Üí runs validation tests ‚Üí creates AMI.

4. **Image Distribution**  
   Automatically shares the AMI across accounts or regions as configured. Supports naming and versioning.

5. **Cleanup**  
   Temporary build resources (EC2, volumes, etc.) are auto-deleted after completion.
